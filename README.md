# Hypothesis-Testing-with-Men-s-and-Women-s-Soccer-Matches
A hypothesis test was conducted to ascertain if the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches differs from men's, using data from Official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002-01-01. The null hypothesis posited that the mean goals in women's matches are equal to those in men's matches, while the alternative hypothesis suggested a difference between them. Mean goals, standard deviations, standard error of the difference, and a t-statistic were computed. Based on the obtained p-value compared to a significance level of 0.10, a decision was made to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
